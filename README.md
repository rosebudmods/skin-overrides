# skin overrides

a powerful mod for changing skins and capes!

skin overrides is a mod that allows you to change your skin or cape on the fly: useful for anything from [roleplay](https://rosebud.dev/skin-overrides/tips-and-tricks/#for-roleplay) to [skin artistry](https://rosebud.dev/skin-overrides/tips-and-tricks/#for-skin-artists).

from the [overrides screen](https://rosebud.dev/skin-overrides/usage/#adding-an-override), you can change any player's skin or cape to whatever your heart desires! this can be accessed from mod menu or by pressing the overrides key (defaults to O). from here, you can configure, add or remove overrides.

you can store a collection of skins and capes in [your personal library](https://rosebud.dev/skin-overrides/usage/#the-library). this allows you to easily switch between a few skins, and can also enable you to [share your override with other online players](https://rosebud.dev/skin-overrides/networking/)!

if skin overrides is [installed on the server](https://rosebud.dev/skin-overrides/networking/), when you use a library override, everyone will be able to see it, even if they don't have the mod!

similarly, you can [change your skin](https://rosebud.dev/skin-overrides/usage/#changing-my-skin) from within the mod, which will update it for everyone online if installed on the server.

skin overrides also supports a wide variety of minecraft versions - [as early back as 1.14.4](https://rosebud.dev/skin-overrides/compatibility/). for technical reasons, only versions since 1.19.4 have the ui, and the server behaviour.

skin overrides also intends to keep compatibility with other skin related mods, such as [ears](https://modrinth.com/mod/mfzaZK3Z) and [3D skin layers](https://modrinth.com/mod/zV5r3pPn). see the [compatibility page](https://rosebud.dev/skin-overrides/compatibility/) for more info!
