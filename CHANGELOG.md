skin overrides' biggest update yet! the big highlight is networking: you can now share your override with the other players online!

- networking! (1.20.6+)
  - when connected to a server with skin overrides installed, your own override will be shared
  - this only works for overrides from your library
  - other players online will be able to see the change instantly, even if they don't have the mod
  - for more information, see [here](https://rosebud.dev/skin-overrides/networking/)
- your skin can now be changed from in game!
  - press the "change skin globally" button on your own profile to do this
  - if skin overrides is on the server, other people will see the change instantly, even if they don't have the mod
  - for more information, see [here](https://rosebud.dev/skin-overrides/usage/#changing-my-skin)
- skin and cape previews are now in 3D
  - can be spun by dragging
  - when viewing a skin in the library, the cape can be hidden or shown as elytra
  - when viewing a cape in the library, it can be shown as elytra, and the player model can be hidden
- bundles of bravery (1.21.3) is now supported!
- 1.14.4, 1.18.1, and 1.19 are no longer supported
  - the support system is now simpler: the 10 latest drops will be supported (for more info, see [here](https://rosebud.dev/skin-overrides/compatibility/))
- added a new `txt` skin provider to copy from an existing profile (see [here](https://rosebud.dev/skin-overrides/advanced/#txt-files))
