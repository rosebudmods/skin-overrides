- textures are no longer eagerly loaded, which should reduce memory usage when using iris ([gh#21](https://github.com/rosebudmods/skin-overrides/issues/21))
- valid PNGs are now always accepted, even if they aren't named .png
- uploading a file which is not a PNG now gives a warning instead of crashing ([gh#20](https://github.com/rosebudmods/skin-overrides/issues/20))
- fixed ears sometimes not working on 1.21.4+
  - the builtin `SkinTextureDownloader.registerTextureInManager` method is now used, allowing it to be used for injecting
- fixed another mystery crash ([gh#19](https://github.com/rosebudmods/skin-overrides/issues/19))
